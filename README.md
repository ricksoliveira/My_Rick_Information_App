# My Rick Info

---

- **What is My Rick Info?**

  My Rick Information is an android app developed using `Flutter` framework and `Dart` language. It was basically created to gather information about myself in a cool way. Well what is cooler than having your resumee inside an app you programed yourself while learning ?.
  Such information include my resumee, goals, contact info, information about my grades, links to personal projects and more.


- **How can I get this app?**

  First things first, this app only works with `android`, it is **NOT** compatible with `ios`.
  
  If you have an android smartphone, you can simply scan this QR code below, it will automatically redirect you to a folder in my Google drive with the `.apk` inside it.
  
  Then you just proceed the instructions in your phone when asked to download and install.
  
  **- Warning: You may have to enable the permission in your phone to allow third party applications.**
